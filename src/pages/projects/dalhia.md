Dalhia Brand is an online store dedicated to my clothing brand, DALHIA, offering a complete shopping experience for users. The platform allows customers to:

- Browse through the product catalog, which includes a wide range of clothing items.
- View each product in detail, including size options and specific features.
- Select the appropriate size and add products to the shopping cart.
- Manage their shopping cart, with options to add or remove items.
- Complete the purchase through a secure payment gateway provided by Redsys.
- Track their orders directly from the platform.

Currently, the application is down due to lack of time and maintenance. However, it is planned to be reactivated in the near future.

The application has been developed using modern technologies: the frontend is built with Angular and deployed on Vercel, while the backend uses Django and is deployed on AWS. The system is fully containerized using Docker to facilitate deployment and environment management. Version control is handled through Git, and the database used is PostgreSQL.
